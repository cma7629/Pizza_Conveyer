The following Application is for our VR Final Assignment. 

What we have created is a game where the player creates pizzas generated from a random order slip.
The player must pickup and drop the toppings availible onto the pizza moving on the belt to complete the order. If the order is correct the player will recive a amount of money based on the number of toppings.
